                <p>It seemed like there were plenty of personal finance apps in the market. Why weren’t they working?</p>
                    
                <p><i>Disclaimer: the features highlighted in my analysis are only up to date as of the time of this project (Summer 2018). Recent app updates that resolve the issues I discuss are not reflected.</i></p>
                
                <h4>1. Mint: "All-in-one finances"</h4>
                    <p>Since Mint was created in 2006, the platform has grown to have over 20 million users. However, we also found that only 8% of their users are young adults, and that 59% of users stop using Mint after a month of signing up. Why was Mint struggling to capture and retain the attention of young spenders?</p>
                <div class="inline-image">
                        <img src='assets/Dumpling/mint.png'>
                        <div class="caption">Developing and testing the spending score algorithm.</div>
                </div>
                    <p>Mint advertises itself as an “all-in-one money management app” and is certainly feature-packed, but many of those features would not be applicable to full-time students without stable salaried jobs.</p>
                    <p>In my testing, Mint was so full of negative red messages and warnings — I understood why so many young users abandoned the app so quickly. So at the opposite end of the spectrum, I examined Joy.</p>
                <h4>2. Joy: “spend happier”</h4>
                    Joy’s pastel aesthetic and claims to help users “spend happier” seemed to appeal to a younger college-age audience.
                    <div class="inline-image">
                        <img src='assets/Dumpling/Joy.png'>
                    </div>
                    <p>In its efforts to encourage “happier spending”, the app was focused on binary ratings for each spend: a green smiley face or a red frown. While it was an exciting unique approach, rating my spending was never simply happy or sad. How would I categorize an impulsive and financially irresponsible (yet delicious) burger outing I joined when I had packed a lunch? What about filling a prescription? Buying fertilizer for my house plants? Joy oversimplified the rating system as most of my transactions could not simply be labeled as happy or sad, and I struggled to see how this style of categorization would improve my approach toward my spending.</p>

                    <p>I’ve been using NRC for several years. I knew it had been very effective in helping me improve my lifestyle, but I wanted to understand why.</p>

                    <p>After I started completing Global Challenges, I dragged several friends to sign up for the app so we could create our own custom challenges. Every time the app alerted me that a friend started a run, I felt more compelled to get off the couch myself. The challenges channeled our competitive spirit and brought out some snarky trash-talk that pushed us to run more.</p>

                    <div class="project-text-content-subhead">Competitor Analysis Takeaways:</div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Do use some competitive element for motivation. Even tiny badges offer a sense of accomplishment, and competing with friends can be positive peer pressure.</li>
                        <li>Don’t bombard users with negative feedback without providing any feasible solutions.</li>
                        <li>Do consider that people have different values and priorities regarding our spending which should not be neglected.</li>
                        <li>Don’t lose young adult audiences with overwhelming and hyperspecific long-term goals.</li>
                        <li>Do only share high-level stats with friends and keep sensitive details hidden from profiles, especially regarding personal finances.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We looked at our own lives and wondered why we didn’t use these finance apps. We asked ourselves what we needed, researched the market to find parallels, and looked at competitors to see what they were distinctly lacking.</p>

                <div class="project-text-body"><p>I’ll focus on two of our core features: Spending Score and social features.</p>
                    <div class="project-text-content-subhead">Spending Score</div>
                    <div class="blockquote">Problem: students don’t know what good spending looks like.<br/>
                    Our goal: to help students spend smarter by teaching them how to think about their spending.</div>
                    <p>We decided to assign each purchase a Spending Score out of 100. Similar to a credit score, a Spending Score could provide an easy snapshot of one’s spending effectiveness. For example, a Spending Score of 78 could mean that 78 of every 100 dollars is well spent. A numerical rating would also help students visualize improvement over time.</p>
                    <p>To build the Spending Score algorithm, we decided to ask users to complete a “Check-in” after each purchase. By prompting students to answer a short set of questions reflecting upon each purchase, we hoped to train students to ask themselves important questions before spending their money, thus teaching them how to think about spending.</p>
                    <p>But what exactly would a Check-in entail? What factors do we and should we consider when deciding whether to make a purchase?</p>
                    <p>We interviewed several 17–22-year-old students to share a few recent purchases and explain their thought processes before spending, as well as reflecting on how satisfied they were with each spend.</p>
                    
                    <div class="inline-image">
                        <img src="assets/Dumpling/check-in%20research.png">
                        <div class="caption">What do you ask yourself before you make a purchase?</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>The questions we gathered confirmed that our thought processes around purchase decisions are far more complex than any binary rating. But how could we capture these considerations in a check-in process that was short enough to complete for every purchase, yet not oversimplified like Joy?</p>
                    
                    <p>First of all, we had to recognize that <b>questions would vary significantly by category</b>: while asking how valuable a purchase would be in the long term could be an important consideration when buying a toaster, it would not be applicable for evaluating a restaurant meal.</p>
                    
                    <p>After extensive testing and dozens of iterations, we decided that ultimately how ‘smart’ a spend was all came down to 5 main factors:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Did you need it?</li>
                        <li>How much did you want it/was it an impulsive purchase?</li>
                        <li>Was it a good value?</li>
                        <li>Can you afford it?</li>
                        <li>What is the short-term impact on your financial goals?</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>But we had to remember that <b>different people have different values toward spending</b>: some never purchase anything without at least 3 weeks of research and agony, while others spend more freely and are equally satisfied with their spending. To understand these factors, we had to weigh each Check-in question differently based upon a set of questions in the onboarding process:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>What is your goal minimum amount you aim to keep in your bank account at all times?</li>
                        <li>When making a purchase, how important is the need you have for an item? (1–5)</li>
                        <li>When making a purchase, how much do you take into consideration how long you have been looking for a similar item? (1–5)</li>
                        <li>If you go into a purchase with an amount you are willing to spend on the item, how much do you take that amount into consideration? (1–5)</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>With that, our backend developer constructed an algorithm to score each purchase and used exponential moving averaging to calculate an overall spending score that would update with each new purchase.</p>
                    
                    <div class="inline-image">
                        <img src="assets/Dumpling/spending%20score%20testing.png">
                        <div class="caption">Developing and testing the spending score algorithm.</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>We designed the check-in flow to be short and simple. It needed to be concise so that users could quickly click through it while waiting for a class to start, riding a bus, or right before going to bed. Questions were designed to be short so that eventually rather than using check-in as a reflection after the fact, students could easily <b>internalize the questions and ask themselves before spending money.</b></p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>But even if we had a working algorithm, we had to keep students using the app, which brings me to our secondary focus.</p>
                    
                    <div class="project-text-content-subhead">Social Features</div>

            <div class="project-text-body">
                <p>Due to the nature of the program, we were expected to have a functional MVP to demo in 9 weeks. Since our developers had no experience with React and would be learning on the fly, we jumped into development and unfortunately neglected the important stages of conducting user research and defining the problem.</p>
                
                <p>This was my first experience as a UI/UX designer, and I did not fully embrace the iterative design process until several weeks into the summer. I was so enthusiastic about using Sketch for the first time and distracted by all the beautiful examples I found on Dribbble and Pinterest, so I began working on pixel-perfect prototypes without enough rounds of iteration and user testing feedback on low-fidelity mockups. However, I was forced to realize the importance of feedback and putting screens in front of users to make sure our solution was still relevant to the problems users face.</p>
                
                <p>Regrets aside, this was an incredible learning experience. Through working directly with developers, I learned to compromise flourish for feasibility to finish with an MVP. And while I’d read about the iterative human-centered design process, I had never actually applied it before. Getting this opportunity to see the human-centered design process in action (and experiencing the pitfalls of neglecting the early stages) showed me how important feedback and communication are to a team’s success.</p>
