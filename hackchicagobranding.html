                    <div class="project-text-content-subhead">Background</div>
                    Since co-founding my high school's Hack Club chapter and spearheading new initiatives and events like <a href="https://camp.masonhackclub.com/" class="link">Mason Hack Camp</a> and <a href="https://2017.cincyhacks.com/" class="link">CincyHacks</a>, I had always been the go-to for logo and flyer designs. I was approached by Hack Club founder Zach Latta to design the branding for Hack Chicago and set the precedent for the rest of the series of Hack Club's flagship hackathons.

            <div class = "project-body-section">
                <div class="project-text-subhead"><h3>Process</h3></div>
                <div class="project-text-body">
                    <div class="project-text-content-subhead">My goal was to design a brand that is:</div>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span class="li-subhead">Adaptable for future events</span><br/>Hack Club envisioned Hack Chicago to continue as a series of Hack hackathons in cities throughout the midwest. With this in mind, I wanted to create a distinct style to unify the various events hosted in different cities and remain easily adaptable for different cities for future events. However, I still wanted to highlight the unique elements of each particular city.</li>
                        <li><span class="li-subhead">Unique to Chicago</span><br/>I wanted to incorporate some essence of Chicago, a city known for it's resilience and innovative architecture as it was rebuilt from the ground up after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.</li>
                        <li><span class="li-subhead">Welcoming for new students and high schoolers</span><br/>As a high school hackathon, the majority of attendees would be fairly new to coding, and Hack Chicago would likely be the students' first hackathon experience. Additionally, with the general lack of hackathons in the Midwest (especially compared to the Bay Area), the majority of students would not know what a hackathon is, and would potentially think of 'hacking' as malicious and illicit. The overall brand needed to make hackathons seem positive, fun, and welcoming to students of all backgrounds and experience levels. Ultimately, this was not only a task to craft the image of Hack Chicago, but also technology as a whole for beginners.</li>
                        <li><span class="li-subhead">Unlike other hackathons</span><br/>I did not want the brand to scream technology with sharp geometric shapes or brackets and slashes common to collegiate hackathon branding, as these images could intimidate curious first-time hackers. I especially wanted to avoid the classic hexagon logo common throughout other collegiate MLH hackathons. Hack Chicago needed to be distinct as a new kind of hackathon. I wanted to make the brand seem fun and inviting to defy the negative stereotypes about technology being difficult and boring.</li>
