                I started teaching myself Illustrator with a free course on Skillshare, in which the project was to illustrate a day in my life using icons. My first icons illustrated the mundanities of my day as a middle schooler.

                <div class="project-inline-image" style="background-image: url('assets/Noun%20Project/dayinthelife.png');"><span class="caption">A day in the life of 8th grade Annie.</span></div>

            <div class = "project-body-section">
                <div class="project-text-subhead"><h3>Designing for Accessibility</h3></div>
                <div class="project-text-body">
                As I continued exploring, I wanted to use icons to facilitate more meaningful communication. The following collections were inspired by my own struggles to teach my grandmother in China how to use technology over video calls. 
                    
                <div class="project-inline-image" style="background-image: url('assets/Noun Project/grandma.png');"><span class="caption">Video-calling my adorable (and surprisingly tech-savy) grandma in China and trying to help her set up iCloud photos.</span></div>
                    
                I wanted to use the visual language of icons to help people overcome language barriers to learning technology. This was my first exploration in using design to make technology more accessible.

                Since I started in December 2014, I now have over 120 icons published on the Noun Project which have accumulated over 29,000 total downloads.
